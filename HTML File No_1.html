        Our Research Project (Also known as the "Robotics Project") is the (Kidמד), and it is a thermometer, that connected with Bluetooth to a motor, that will rotate the gas handle when it reaches the temperature that the user set or reaches the limit (80° Celsius). Additionally, the user can set the timer, that will turn off the gas automatically when it reaches the end of the set time. But, we don't want to abruptly turn the gas off. So, to solve the problem, the fire becomes lower.
